## Introduction

The project is a mobile application for mental health and risk stratification based on neighborhood characteristics for both Apple and Android platforms. Virtually no research exists examining the daily influence of environmental factors on the development of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia. Our solution is a mobile app that collects real-time data (daily survey) on the status of the user‚Äôs mental health such as their feelings and emotions in relation to their location during the day. We can compile and organize this data into a database for our client and other clinicians to analyze and can better treat their own patients and gain knowledge of the development of mental health disorders.

**The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms.**

## Troubleshooting
1.	Users can‚Äôt receive notification.
- Notification seems to have bugs after we did beta testing on Apple TestFlight. Users can try to reset their notification schedules by long pressing the ‚ÄúNot Available‚Äù or ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button on the home screen. There will be an option to reset the notification. Please reload the app after reset.
2.	The app can‚Äôt automatically sign in or can‚Äôt load the questionnaire. 
- When opening the app, the app should be able to automatically sign users in if they have signed in before. However, the app currently doesn‚Äôt have a loading screen, so the users might need to wait a few seconds depending on the network conditions.
3.	Users can‚Äôt submit the questionnaire.
- The app will fetch users‚Äô location when they are answering the questionnaire. When the click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù, the app will check if the location is fetched. If not, it might take a few seconds to fetch the location again and upload the answers to backend (which can also take a few seconds depending on the network conditions). Users can wait a few seconds and the answers should be recorded automatically. 
4.	Some Android users might can‚Äôt submit questionnaire.
- This is a problem of expo-location (a package we used) on some Android devices. During our beta testing, we identified the problem and tried to fix it, and the location services worked on the Android device we used. However, there might be some edge cases for other Android devices that we haven‚Äôt tested on.
